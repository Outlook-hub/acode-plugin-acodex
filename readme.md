[AcodeX](https://github.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex) is a powerful plugin for the Acode app that enhances your coding productivity by adding terminal support. With AcodeX, you can execute terminal commands directly within the Acode app, eliminating the need to switch between apps for coding and terminal access.

> **Note**: When starting a new terminal, be sure to adjust the terminal panel according to your screen. You can drag it to your desired position, and it will automatically adjust the columns and rows according to your screen size.
