# AcodeX - Terminal Emulator


> [!Warning]
> This plugin requires the [acodex-server](https://github.com/bajrangCoder/AcodeX-server) NodeJS package to be installed and running on [Termux](https://termux.dev).

[AcodeX](https://github.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex) is a powerful plugin for [Acode](https://acode.foxdebug.com/) that enhances your coding productivity by adding in-app Termux terminal integration. With AcodeX, you can execute terminal commands directly from within the Acode app, eliminating the need to switch between apps for coding and terminal access.

> [!Note]
> When starting a new terminal, be sure to adjust the terminal panel according to your screen. You can drag it to your desired position, and it will automatically adjust the columns and rows according to your screen size.

## Prerequisites

To use AcodeX, you need to have the [Termux app](https://termux.dev/en/) installed on your Android device. However, you don't need to switch between apps to use the terminal, as AcodeX offers a convenient way to access the terminal directly within the Acode app with the help of Termux.

## Installation

1. Install the plugin in the Acode App from `Acode > Settings > Plugins > AcodeX`.

2. Install the server in Termux using the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex/main/installServer.sh | bash
```

or 

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python nodejs -y
npm i -g acodex-server
```

Basically just install `python` & `nodejs` and then just install `acodex-server` npm package globally

> [!Note]
> You can uninstall python after successful installation of `acodex-server`

## How to Use

> **Tutorial link**: [https://youtu.be/sXlIhrbpjyw](https://youtu.be/sXlIhrbpjyw)

- Start the server in Termux using: `acodeX-server`.
- To use AcodeX, press `Ctrl+K` or search for `"Open Terminal"` in the command palette (press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette).
- Enter the port number, and the terminal will start.
- Plus `+` icon to create new session 
- Use the minus icon button to hide the terminal while coding and the terminal button to show it.
- You can also drag the terminal panel around by clicking and dragging through the terminal header area.
- The `‚úó` button is for closing the terminal.
- The folder icon button on the terminal header is for navigating to opened files (in the editor) directory.
