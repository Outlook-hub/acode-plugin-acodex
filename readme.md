# AcodeX - Terminal Emulator

> [!Warning]
> This plugin requires the [acodex-server](https://github.com/bajrangCoder/AcodeX-server) NodeJS package to be installed and running on [Termux](https://termux.dev).

[AcodeX](https://github.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex) is a powerful and AI integrated terminal plugin with **70k++ downloads** for [Acode](https://acode.foxdebug.com/) that enhances your coding productivity by adding in-app Termux terminal integration. With AcodeX, you can execute terminal commands directly from within the Acode app, eliminating the need to switch between apps for coding and terminal access.

> [!Note]
> When starting a new terminal, be sure to adjust the terminal panel according to your screen. You can drag it to your desired position, and it will automatically adjust the columns and rows according to your screen size.

## Prerequisites

To use AcodeX, you need to have the [Termux app](https://termux.dev/en/) installed on your Android device. However, you don't need to switch between apps to use the terminal, as AcodeX offers a convenient way to access the terminal directly within the Acode app with the help of Termux.

## Installation

1. Install the plugin in the Acode App from `Acode > Settings > Plugins > AcodeX`.

2. Install the server in Termux using the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex/main/installServer.sh | bash
```

or

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python nodejs -y
npm i -g acodex-server
```

Basically just install `python` & `nodejs` and then just install `acodex-server` npm package globally

But if you are installing it on termux then make sure to run this command first to bypass the termux specific issue:

```bash
cd $HOME && mkdir -p .gyp && echo "{'variables': {'android_ndk_path': ''}}" > .gyp/include.gypi
```

> [!Note]
> You can uninstall python after successful installation of `acodex-server`

## How to Use

> **Tutorial link**: [https://youtu.be/sXlIhrbpjyw](https://youtu.be/sXlIhrbpjyw)

- Start the server in Termux using: `acodeX-server`.
- To use AcodeX, press `Ctrl+K` or search for `"Open Terminal"` in the command palette (press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette).
- Enter the port number, and the terminal will start.
- Plus `+` icon to create new session 
- Use the minus icon button to hide the terminal while coding and the terminal button or `Ctrl-Shift-T` to show it.
- You can also drag the terminal panel around by clicking and dragging through the terminal header area.
- The `‚úó` button is for closing the terminal.
- The folder icon button on the terminal header is for navigating to opened files (in the editor) directory.

## Additional Terminal Keybindings

AcodeX provides some additional Keybindings for easy usability of terminal features.

> [!Note]
> These keybindings will only work if you will use these inside terminal only. except the * marked one

Following are the supported Keybindings :

- <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> : opens a new terminal session 
- <kbd>Ctrl+W</kbd> : close opened terminal session 
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> : paste something from clipboard inside your terminal
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd> : copy selected text from terminal
- <kbd>Ctrl+Left Arrow</kbd> : open previous session corresponding to current one like if current one is session 2 then it will open session 1(if exists)
- <kbd>Ctrl+Right Arrow</kbd> : open next session corresponding to current one like if current one is session 2 then it will open session 2(if exists)
- <kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> : opens session 1
- <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd> : opens session 2 if exists
- <kbd>Ctrl+3</kbd> : opens session 3 if exists
- <kbd>Ctrl+4</kbd> : opens session 4 if exists
- <kbd>Ctrl+5</kbd> : opens session 5 if exists
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> : clear the terminal 
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+T</kbd> : Maximise the terminal *

### How to Use AI

To leverage the power of artificial intelligence within `AcodeX Terminal` Plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain API Key**: Before using the AI capabilities, you need to acquire an API key for the respective model you wish to utilize. Visit the website of your chosen model and obtain the API key. Once obtained, navigate to the AcodeX settings and input the API key. Additionally, you can select your preferred model from the list of currently supported models, which include:
   - Deepseek : [Get API key üöÄ](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)
   - Chatgpt : [Get API key üöÄ](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   - Gemini-Pro(default) : [Get API key üöÄ](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

2. **Accessing AI in the Terminal**:
   - To access the AI functionality within the terminal, simply type `#`. This action will prompt a popup window to appear.
   - Within the popup window, you can input your prompt or query.
   - Upon entering your prompt, click the button provided to prompt the AI to generate a command based on your input.
   - The generated command will be written into the terminal. From there, you have the option to execute the command as is or modify it according to your requirements.

> [!Warning]
> Avoid prompts that may lead the AI to provide descriptive or explanatory responses instead of actionable commands.

> [!Note]
> Use AI wisely, as there may be token limits associated with your API key. Be mindful of your usage to avoid exceeding token limits and potential interruptions in service.

We value your feedback! Please provide any suggestions or feedback to help us improve the AI integration and suggest additional AI models for future enhancements.

Stay tuned for more AI integrations and improvements coming soon üòä!
